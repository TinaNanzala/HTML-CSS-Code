<p>Living a healthier life might seem like a tall order — the nutrition, the exercise, 
the inner happiness! But having some friendly advice at your disposal, whenever and wherever you need it, makes it easier and more fun.</p>
<p>Healthy living makes one have a longer life cycle, hence it's advised by some of the vegeterians known all over,most people in this century that we are living rarely practice the art of healthy dieting, hence most of them are obese and also diebetic which at times leads to loss of lives.</p>
<p>If you have any relative or friends or even you who is reading this and you think its true , Vegeterian is the way to go. 
That said, following a vegetarian diet “can be nutritionally superior to any other way of eating,” says Tallmadge. “It can be one of the healthiest ways to eat, because we know plant foods are loaded with nutrient to protect our health.
<p>“A vegetarian diet doesn’t necessarily lead to weight loss -- especially if you eat out at restaurants often,” says Tallmadge a health practitioner. “A lot of times, the only vegetarian dishes on the menu are cheesy and fattening.” It can be hard to find restaurants serving soy burgers or beans and rice, and eating restaurant-size portions of pasta, rice, nuts and cheese could quickly add up to weight gain. According to Tallmadge, the desire to eat lighter meals that provide adequate protein is what makes many vegetarians change their minds and start eating fish.</p>
If you're considering going vegetarian, keep these tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
   <p><li>There are numerous research-proven health benefits to following a vegetarian diet, but only if you’re doing it properly and not substituting meat with processed or high-fat vegetarian products.</li></p>
   <p><li>Both lacto-ovo vegetarians and vegans need to make sure they are getting adequate nutrition. It’s a good idea to purchase a book on how to follow a vegetarian diet, or to meet with a nutritionist to outline what a few days of meals looks like.</li></p>
  <p><li>Be aware of how much of your diet is made up of nuts as a source of protein, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. An ounce of nuts is about 180 calories and 5 grams of protein. You should be getting between 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal.</li></p>
   <p>So: You’d have to eat thousands of calories worth of something like nuts in order to get the amount of protein you need to be healthy, according to Tallmadge. They’re a healthy food, but high in fat and calories.So be sure to round out your diet with a variety of vegetarian proteins.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>While walking just on the streets of Nairobi, I just try to keep it calm cause it really annoys me seeing how people treat their bodies. So dear reader I would like to udge you to try and refrain from the unhealthy dieting behavior.</p>
